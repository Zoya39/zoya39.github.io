              The analysis is created for the medical staffing agency that
              provides temporary staff to hospitals and clinics. The project
              aimed to proactively plan staffing needs for the upcoming
              influenza season across the United States. This involved analyzing
              historical data related to influenza and staffing requirements.

              The analysis encompassed formulating a hypothesis based on
              conducted research indicating a higher incidence of
              influenza-related deaths among adults aged 65 and above.
            </p>
            <p class="project-content">
              The process also involved conducting a descriptive analysis to
              evaluate the correlation between influenza deaths and the size of
              the population age groups. The data limitations were considered,
              and the spread of the data was evaluated in conjunction with the
              t-test to compare the number of deaths among different age groups.
              Furthermore, the need for additional information on vulnerability
              and vaccination rates was identified.

              The data on influenza Deaths don’t confirm the assumption about a
              higher number of Deaths in the age group +80 : shows linear
              progression in Deaths/Population, and the level of outliners
              occurrence is mostly near the allowed level of 5%.

              The Influenza Deaths have a very strong (94%) correlation to the
              population age group size. That is, the data confirm that
              influenza-related Deaths are the age-dependent parameter in groups
              over 65.

              <b>Evidenced pattern and recommendations:</b>
            </p>
            <p class="project-content">
              Influenza infections are associated with thousands of deaths every
              year in the United States, with the majority of deaths from
              seasonal influenza occurring among adults aged ≥65 years. Other
              research gives the mean age at death, as 72.7 years.
            </p>
            <p class="project-content">
              My research confirms the first assumption. Therefore, the
              recommendation is to focus on the +65 age group of the population
              and to plan the additional staff for regions with a larger group
              of people 65+ because the corresponding influenza mortality will
              be higher.
